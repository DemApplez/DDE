# DDE
DDE, or Doors Desktop Environment is a GUI built for CC Tweaked/CC Restiched, A Minecraft mod that adds computers into the game.

This Github Page for Doors (DDE's Nickname) Comes with everything you'd need to start using it in a multiplayer server, including a server file you can run to allow for a Messaging App, Product Keys and Activation stuff, and more. It also comes with a Manual to download to print out and give to others.

Doors is built and styled the way it is to represent older Operating Systems from the 90s and earlier, more specifically Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS Version 6. Currently the project is in its early stages and only has a limited amount of functionality. Most stuff included is functional, but can have major bugs and/or can break at any moment.

Current Version: DDE Version 0.6(ish)
